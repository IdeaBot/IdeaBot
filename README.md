# IdeaBot #
Hello! Welcome to IdeaBot's repository.

Idea is an open-source modular discord bot.
Originally developed as a side project to meet the needs of the Idea Project community server,
Idea has grown into a powerful bot for programmers and users.
Idea has lots of [useful features](https://github.com/IdeaBot/IdeaBot/wiki/Feature-Overview) available to everyone for free!
Idea also allows users to build their own commands with the easy to learn [Python language](https://www.python.org/).
To get started, [add Idea to your server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=397854238774001673&scope=bot&permissions=268561472).

This is the best option for regular Discord users, since you don't have to worry about keeping Idea working.
If you want an easy plug-and-play option, this is the option for you!
This version of Idea comes with a lot of useful add-ons pre-installed ([see basic features](https://github.com/IdeaBot/IdeaBot/wiki/Basic-Usage)).

>***Self-hosted***
This is the best option for the devs and curious users, since it allows you to maintain and modify Idea without affecting anyone else.
If you want to help by contributing to the IdeaBot repository, this is the best option for you.
Unfortunately, this requires a reasonable knowledge of computers and Discord.

## Development Goals ##

**Simple and Modular**

These are requirements Idea development is always striving to achieve and maintain.
Development goals aren't just hopes and dreams, but rules to follow when approaching development problems.

### Modular ###
**Everything is optional**

IdeaBot's structure allows for plugins, commands and reactions to be added and removed easily.
This makes IdeaBot's functionality easily upgradable and modifiable.
In order to achieve modularity, IdeaBot's core is simple but powerful.
With modularity comes versatility; if Idea can't do something, anyone can write code to fix that.

### Simple ###
**IdeaBot aims to be easy to use and improve.**

Development and usage of Idea should be simple.
Unnecessary complexity is unnecessary; complexity detracts from the user experience.
This also extends to the development process.
