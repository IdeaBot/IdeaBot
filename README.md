Fear this bot and it's horrible code!

The coding right now is (slighty less) dirty and (slightly less) horrible, but that's ok, because it's early in development.
Release v1.0 or perhaps v0.9 will likely be a code cleanup and optimization, but until then: If it works, don't fix it!
(Unless you want to, in which case feel free, we'll love you forever if you make it run faster than it currently does)

## General Guidelines for Contributing
Considering that the first sentence people will see when they come to this page insults the quality of the code, any code submitted should be decent.
It doesn't have to be the fastest, or the cleanest, but it has to be well documented and understandable (and not just for yourself).
Any code that doesn't meet those standards will probably be rejected. At best it will be cleaned up and then merged.
