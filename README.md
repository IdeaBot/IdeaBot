# IdeaBot
Hello! Welcome to IdeaBot's repository.

Before we start, here are some important links:

* [IdeaBot Discord server](https://discord.gg/gwq2vS7) for bot questions and development help
* [IdeaBot Trello,](https://trello.com/b/SZ8OkrO6/ideabot-development) which outlines future plans
* [Bugs & feature requests](https://github.com/NGnius/IdeaBot/issues)

## Development Aims and Goals

We want Idea to be a good all-purpose option with an amazing user experience. 
We want to accomplish that by making Idea modular, fast, simple and intuitive.

### Modular
IdeaBot's structure allows for plugins, commands and reactions to be added and removed easily. 
This makes IdeaBot's functionality easily upgradable.
It also makes patching easy.
This is very important in making IdeaBot versatile and useful to users.

### Fast
Any good code is well-optimized. IdeaBot is not an exception to that rule. 
A slow bot leads to a horrible user-experience.
As new features are released for IdeaBot, parts of Idea's code are rewritten and optimized.
In the future, a full release cycle (v1.0 or v0.9) will likely be dedicated to rewrites & optimizations, but for now Idea is already plenty responsive.

Ideally, IdeaBot should be able to run on a Raspberry Pi. 
Realistically, Raspberry Pis are potatoes and IdeaBot shouldn't be expected to run on a potato.

### Simple
Development and usage of Idea should be simple. 
Unnecessary complexity is unnecessary; Complexity in a simple task detracts from the user experience. 
Similarly, complexity in development detracts from and slows down the development process.
IdeaBot aims to be easy to use, and easy to improve. 
Without users and developers, IdeaBot development will never achieve it's goals.

### Intuitive
Counter-intuitive and arbitrary scenarios aren't fun. Idea aims to make all interaction intuitive, so that commands are easy.

Development is the same; adding plugins, reactions and commands should be intuitive so that almost anyone can add their own functionality for IdeaBot. 
To achieve this, release v1.0 or perhaps v0.9 will likely be a code cleanup and optimization. 
Until then: If it works, don't fix it! (Unless you want to, in which case feel free, we'll love you forever)
