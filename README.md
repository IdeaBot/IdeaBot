# IdeaBot
Hello! Welcome to IdeaBot's repository.

Idea is an open-source modular discord bot.
Originally developed as a side project to meet the needs of the Idea Project community server,
Idea has grown into a powerful bot for programmers and users alike.
Idea focuses on allowing users to build their own commands with the easy to learn [Python language](https://www.python.org/).
To get started,
[add Idea to your server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=397854238774001673&scope=bot&permissions=268561472).

### Idea Flavours ###

>***Self-hosted***
This is the easier option for the devs and curious users, since it allows you to maintain and modify Idea without affecting anyone else.
If you want to help by contributing to the IdeaBot repository, this is the best option for you.
Unfortunately, this requires a reasonable knowledge of computers and Discord.
To get started with self-hosted, check out [Idea's wiki](https://github.com/NGnius/IdeaBot/wiki).

>***Dev-hosted***
This is the easier option for users and server owners, since you don't have to worry about maintaining Idea.
If you want an easy plug-and-play option, this is the option for you!
Unfortunately, adding your own add-ons to Idea is harder.
To solve that, Idea comes with a lot of useful add-ons pre-installed ([see basic features](https://github.com/NGnius/IdeaBot/wiki/Basic-Usage)).
To get started with dev-hosted, [invite Idea to your server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=397854238774001673&scope=bot&permissions=268561472).

## Development Aims and Goals

**Modular, Fast, Simple and Intuitive**

These are requirements Idea development is always striving to achieve and maintain.
We want Idea to be a good all-purpose option with an amazing user experience.
To accomplish that, we are constantly improving Idea.

### Modular
**Everything is optional**

IdeaBot's structure allows for plugins, commands and reactions to be added and removed easily.
This makes IdeaBot's functionality easily upgradable and modifiable.
It also makes patching easy.
This is very important in making IdeaBot versatile and useful to users.
With pre-release v0.7, any add-on can be loaded safely and quickly live.

### Fast
**Ideally, IdeaBot should be able to run on anything that can run Python.**

Any good code is well-optimized. IdeaBot is not an exception to that rule.
A slow bot leads to a horrible user-experience.
As new features are released for IdeaBot, parts of Idea's code are rewritten and optimized.
In the future, a full release cycle (v1.0 or v0.9) will likely be dedicated to rewrites & optimizations, but for now Idea is already plenty responsive.

### Simple
**IdeaBot aims to be easy to use and easy to improve.**

Development and usage of Idea should be simple.
Unnecessary complexity is unnecessary; Complexity in a simple task detracts from the user experience.
Similarly, complexity in development detracts from and slows down the development process.
Lack of simplicity detracts from the user and developer experience, which is bad for everyone.

### Intuitive
**Counter-intuitive and arbitrary scenarios aren't fun.**

Idea aims to make all interaction intuitive, so that users can easily understand how to use Idea.
Development is the same; adding plugins, reactions and commands should be intuitive so that almost anyone can add their own functionality to IdeaBot.
To achieve this, release v1.0 or perhaps v0.9 will likely be a code cleanup and optimization.
Until then: If it works, don't fix it! (Unless you want to, in which case feel free, we'll love you forever)
