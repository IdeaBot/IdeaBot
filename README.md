## Development Goals ##

**Simple and Modular**

These are requirements Idea development is always striving to achieve and maintain.
These goals allow Idea to be a powerful Discord bot while constantly growing and improving.

### Modular ###
**Everything is optional**

IdeaBot's structure allows for plugins, commands and reactions to be added and removed easily.
This makes IdeaBot's functionality easily upgradable and modifiable.
In order to achieve modularity, IdeaBot's core is simple but powerful.
It also makes patching easy.
With modularity comes versatility, which allows Idea to offer a solution to almost any problem.

### Simple ###
**IdeaBot aims to be easy to use and easy to improve.**

Development and usage of Idea should be simple.
Unnecessary complexity is unnecessary; Complexity in a simple task detracts from the user experience.
Similarly, complexity in development detracts from and slows down the development process.
Lack of simplicity detracts from the user and developer experience, which is bad for everyone.
