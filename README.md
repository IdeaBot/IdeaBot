# IdeaBot
Fear this bot and it's horrible code!

The coding right now is dirty and horrible, but that's ok, because it's early in development.
Release v1.0 or perhaps v0.9 will likely be a code cleanup and optimization, but until then: If it works, don't fix it!
(Unless you want to, in which case feel free, we'll love you forever if you make it run faster than it currently does)
