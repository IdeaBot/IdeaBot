# How to contribute

You want to contribute? Cool! We appreciate all help we can get!

This document outlines guidelines for helping IdeaBot grow. 
These are not rules, but the guidelines will make for a more readable and maintainable ecosystem.

Before we start, here are some important links:

* [IdeaBot Discord server](https://discord.gg/gwq2vS7) for bot questions and development help
* [IdeaBot Trello,](https://trello.com/b/SZ8OkrO6/ideabot-development) which outlines future plans
* [Bugs & feature requests](https://github.com/NGnius/IdeaBot/issues)

## The easy stuff

### Insecticide

### Enhance

Make a feature request [here](https://github.com/NGnius/IdeaBot/issues)!

## The harder stuff

### Pull request guidelines

All pull requests (PRs) should contain well commented code. 
We'd love you if you made something so optimised it uses negative CPU time, but other people have to be able to read it too.
If all else fails, make a nice paragraph before the code in question which explains what the code does.
Remember, other people will want to read your code. 
Please respect their eyes and sanity.

IdeaBot's aims to be to be modular, fast, simple and intuitive. We'd love it if you help us achieve those goals.

Also, here's a few best practices for formatting code:
* Spaces, not tabs! We're sorry, Richard.
* Longer isn't always better. A long file might be necessary, but splitting things up might make it easier to add to in the future.
* Whitespace is best space. Putting empy lines between bits of code is great for readability. Darkspace, for all you dark theme aficionados out there.
